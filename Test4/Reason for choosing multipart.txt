I chose multipart/form-data over URL encoding because it effectively supports file uploads along with regular form data, which is important for my application's needs. Multipart encoding handles both text and binary data in one request, keeping file integrity and simplifying further data processing. This approach is already an industry standard for forms with mixed content and, therefore, ensures compatibility with modern browsers and server-side frameworks, making it the best practice for my form.
